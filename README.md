## population of Des Moines vs new York city 

The population between Des Moines and New York City is fairly similar, with 63.8% and 65% of the total populations respectively between the ages of 18 and 65, a positive population growth rate, and near even gender diversity with Des Moines having a 1.5% increase in %male than New York city (reference 1). Furthermore, Des Moines has 3.6% higher average population under the age of 18 (reference 1). From the similarity in general population statistics, we predict that Des Moines bike rental performance will mirror that of New York City. Looking at the positive growth rate of Des Moines, and higher percentage of population under 18 relative to New York, we predict that bike rentals will increase over time as this population ages into or peak rental age range of 19 years to 35 years. 
To conclude, based on the population statistics, investing in Des Moines citi bike sharing will have a similar success initially, and potentially become more successful to New York city over time. 


## How does its population compare to the population of New York City

The overall population of Des Moines is 2.5% of New York City’s population (ref 1). This smaller population will allow for a much smaller initial investment in infrastructure and equipment, fewer employees, and easier management of the company. The previous mentioned population similarities makes Des Moines a great city to begin expanding citi bikes to smaller cities and perfecting the smaller city model. 
Overall commute time in Des Moines is 19min, 22 min shorter than New York City, with Des Moines having a per capita income of $27,325, $10,368 smaller than New York City (ref 1). With shorter commutes, and lower income, bikes are an excellent alternative to the high expense of a car, fixed schedule of public transit, and a positive health choice (Ref 2). Investing in Des Moines citi bike, with targeted advertising has the potential to shift Des Moines into a primarily bike commuter city. 


## Does the population affect the number of people who will use the bike-sharing program?

As mentioned above. With a smaller population, fewer total people will use the bike sharing program. However, in terms of relative population the population demographics suggest Des Moines will have a higher percentage of population that use the bike sharing program. 


## City layout differences

The layout of Des Moines is far more rural than New York city, each with a population per square mile of 2,515.6 and 27,012.5 respectively (ref 1). With a smaller population density Des Moines city will be able to easily implement bike lines for increased bike safety, along with bike paths through green space. These small infrastructure upgrades will increase the number of riders, as biking becomes less risk averse throughout the downtown city area, and even Greater Des Moines area. 


## Tourism in Des Moines

Des Moines has a number of pre existing bike tours (ref 4), showing the biking throughout Des Moines is already an excellent mode of transportation around the city. With Citi Bike’s introduction to Des Moines, people will continue to use the bikes for their own methods of touring throughout the city’s many attraction (ref 3). 


## Weather 

The overall weather in Des Moines is great for biking, with an average temperature of 24.4 dec C in the summer, and 6 deg C in the winter (ref 5). Overall, the weather allows for comfortable biking 9 months of the year. With Des Moines located in a similar longitude to New York, and located farther from large bodies of water that produce snow in the winter, Des Moines has better weather year round for biking than New York City. This will increase the overall number of riders, and increase the number of riders in the winter season.
